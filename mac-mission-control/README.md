# Mission Control Linux Alternative

Mission Control offers a bird's-eye view of all your open windows, desktop spaces, full-screen apps, and Split View spaces, making it easy to switch between them.

GNOME 3 has a very similar feature to Mission Control but, the desktops are lined up vertically. I want them to be lined up horizontally.

Whether you are not using GNOME 3 or you don't like your version, here you have an alternative.

You also have the .deb package in this folder so to install it directly.
